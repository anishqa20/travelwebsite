    <h2>History of Delhi</h2>
    <p>Delhi, the capital of India, is a city steeped in history and culture, dating back thousands of years. Believed to be the ancient Indraprastha from the epic Mahabharata,
     it has served as the seat of power for several dynasties, including the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire, which left behind architectural marvels like the Qutub Minar, Red Fort, and Jama Masjid. During British rule, Delhi was transformed into a modern administrative center, with New Delhi becoming the capital in 1911. Today, Delhi stands as a vibrant metropolis that seamlessly blends its glorious past with contemporary development, making it a unique symbol of India's heritage and progress.</p>
